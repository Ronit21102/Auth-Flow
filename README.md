The flow you're describing outlines the typical process for integrating **Amazon Cognito** for user authentication, with additional steps for verifying the user's account before granting full access. Here's a detailed breakdown of the flow:

### 1. **User Sign-Up**
   - **Action:** The user submits their registration details (like email/phone number, password, etc.) via your application's sign-up form.
   - **Cognito Action:** This triggers the **Cognito User Pool** sign-up API. The user's status is initially set to **"UNCONFIRMED"**.
   - **Verification Method:** Depending on your configuration, Cognito can send a verification code to the user via:
     - **Email** (for email verification)
     - **SMS** (for phone number verification)
   
### 2. **Verification Step**
   - **Action:** The user receives the verification code through email or SMS.
   - **Cognito Action:** The user must enter the verification code in your app to confirm their email/phone number.
   - **Verification Methods:**
     - **Email Verification:** Cognito sends a code to the user's email.
     - **SMS Verification:** If using a phone number, a code is sent via SMS.
   - **Cognito Action on Success:** Upon successful code entry, the user's status changes from **"UNCONFIRMED"** to **"CONFIRMED"**.

### 3. **Add User to Your Database**
   - **Action:** After the user's email/phone verification is complete and their status is updated to **"CONFIRMED"**, you can safely add the user to your application's database (e.g., store their details such as `userID`, `email`, `phone`, etc.).
   - **Important Note:** You will likely store additional user data such as roles, preferences, etc., depending on your application's needs. This can be stored in your DB, while Cognito will maintain authentication-related details.

### 4. **Generate Tokens (Access & Refresh Tokens)**
   - **Action:** After the user is verified and stored in your database, they can log in.
   - **Cognito Action:** The user is now able to authenticate, and Cognito will generate:
     - **Access Token**: This is a short-lived token used for authenticating API requests.
     - **Refresh Token**: This is a longer-lived token used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to log in again.
   - **How Tokens are Generated:**
     - The user sends their credentials (email/phone number + password) to Cognito via the **InitiateAuth** or **AdminInitiateAuth** API.
     - Cognito returns the **Access Token**, **Refresh Token**, and **ID Token** (containing user info).

### 5. **User Authentication & Access Control**
   - **Action:** After the tokens are generated, your app uses the **Access Token** for making authenticated API requests.
   - **Token Validation:** On each request, you validate the **Access Token** using Cognito's public keys to ensure its integrity and authenticity. If the token is valid, the request is processed.
   - **Token Refresh:** When the **Access Token** expires, the **Refresh Token** is used to get a new **Access Token** (via the `RefreshTokens` API).
   
### 6. **Working with the User**
   - **Action:** After successful authentication, you can access user details such as `email`, `userID`, and custom attributes from the **ID Token** or from **Cognito User Pool**.
   - **User Roles & Permissions:** You can also implement role-based access control (RBAC) by storing user roles in Cognito as custom attributes and using them for authorization.

---

### Summary of the Flow:
1. **Sign-up**: User registers via email or phone number.
2. **Pending State**: User is in the "UNCONFIRMED" state.
3. **Verification**: User receives a verification code via email/SMS and confirms the code.
4. **Confirmed State**: Userâ€™s status is now **"CONFIRMED"**, and they are added to your DB.
5. **Authentication**: User logs in, and Cognito generates **Access Token**, **Refresh Token**, and **ID Token**.
6. **Access & Authorization**: Use tokens for authenticated API calls, refresh tokens when needed, and manage roles and permissions.

This flow ensures that user verification is required before giving them full access and allows you to manage user authentication securely with Cognito.
